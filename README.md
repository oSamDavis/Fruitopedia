# Fruitopedia

## Goal

Learn how to make beautiful user interfaces and immersive user experiences with the SwiftUI framework.

## What I created:

Add what Fruitopedia is an mini app that gives nutritional details of different fruits. With Fruitopedia, a user is able to browse through a list of fruits and check nutritional facts and details of that particular fruit. We display an onboarding screen aimed at subtly increasing users' interest, after which the user can browse through a list of fruits and see details of each fruit. There's also a settings screen where the user can reset the onboarding state, thereby trigerring the onboarding screen to display again. 

Because of the power of SwiftUI, this app is available on both iOS and iPad.

## Folder Structure
The main folders live in the Fruitopedia folder
The four major folders are :
Model : contains a data model which describes the schema of a fruit.
Data : contains a huge constant array which contains different fruits.
Views : This is the folder where smaller views/components would live.
Screen : This is the folder where major screens of the app would live.
